# Vue.js Todo App

A simple and elegant todo app built with Vue.js, using the Composition API and Sass for styling. The app has two main components - the `DoneBoard` that displays completed todos, and the `TodoList` that allows adding and marking todos as done. The app makes API calls to retrieve and persist todos.
